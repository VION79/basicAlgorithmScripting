/*
Return Largest Numbers in Arrays
Return an array consisting of the largest number from each provided sub-array. For simplicity, the provided array will contain exactly 4 sub-arrays.

Remember, you can iterate through an array with a simple for loop, and access each member with array syntax arr[i].

largestOfFour([[4, 5, 1, 3], [13, 27, 18, 26], [32, 35, 37, 39], [1000, 1001, 857, 1]]) should return an array.

Code Explanation
Create a variable (max) to store the results as an array.
Create an outer loop to iterate through the outer array.
Create a second variable (largestNumber) to hold the largest number and initialise it with the first number. This must be 
outside an inner loop so it wonâ€™t be reassigned until we find a larger number.
Create said inner loop to work with the sub-arrays.
Check if the element of the sub array is larger than the currently stored largest number. If so, then update the number 
in the variable.
After the inner loop, save the largest number in the corresponding position inside of the results array.
And finally return said array.
